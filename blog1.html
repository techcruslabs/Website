            <p>On Saturday 30th May 2020, SpaceX and NASA launched 2 astronauts into space on the Falcon9 to board the Crew Dragon spacecraft and this is was the very first time a private company has trusted a commercial company to launch astronauts into orbit, “This is a big deal” said the space consultant Laura Forczyk.</p>

            <p>Both veteran NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and
            Douglas Hurley was on a 19-hour journey to the International Space station where they will be spending four months before returning home.</p>

            <p>SpaceX and NASA had geared up for a historic flight on 27th May, but their plan on launching astronauts from the US soil for the first time since the space shuttle programme in 2011 had to be delayed 16 minutes and 53 seconds prior to the launch due to the poor weather conditions. This was because they needed to assure that the staff and the astronauts feel comfortable to take on the mission. “We want people to feel free to say no and not feel any ressure to go on this launch” said Jim Bridenstine on May 26th.</p>

            <p>“Let’s light this candle!” Douglas Hurley said, right before lift-off, the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight in 1961. 2 minutes after the liftoff, the first stage enginer was cut off, thus separating the first and second stages.
            A few moments after the separation, the ignition of the second stage engine began and the Crew Dragon proceeded to reach towards the Earth’s orbit wthin 12minutes of takeoff.
            </p>

            <p>The launch was successfully done as falcon 9 rocket carried the Crew Dragon into orbit from the Kennedy Space Center, this marks a new era of human spaceflight as this also marks the steady progress towards allowing ordinary people to visit space. “This is absolutely opening the doors for more people to go to space” said Forczyk “In the furure, SpaceX could open it up to private astronauts, whether that’s for commercial space tourism or another government that doesn’t have the capability to launch astronauts itself”.
            </p>

            <p>The mission is expected to be over within 30-90 days and then the Crew Dragon would depart from the International Space Station and land in the atlantic ocean once re-entered atmosphere in the Crew Dragon’s capsule.</p>
