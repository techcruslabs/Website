            <p>July 8th 2011 marked the date when the last Space shuttle Atlantis's Commander Chris Ferguson and his three crewmates touch-downed at the Kennedy Space Center,FL.</p>

            <p>Now, after almost 9 years of hard work, perseverance of hundreds of passionate and dedicated people, NASA has ventured with SpaceX to make “America Great Again!”. This project named DEMO-2  will mark the first time in history that a commercial aerospace company has carried humans into Earth's orbit. NASA and space fans have waited nearly a decade for this milestone, which will usher in the return of human spaceflight to US soil.</p>

            <p>Till 31st of May 2020, NASA relied on Russia to take their astronauts into Space mostly to the ISS,a giant orbiting laboratory, fully staffed with US astronauts. The space agency's top official, Jim Bridenstine, also said he hopes this launch will inspire awe and uplift the general public during the ongoing health crisis. NASA was forced to pay almost $86 million for each astronaut to be taken into space by Russia.</p>

            <p>So,annoyed at this expenditure, NASA asked the private sector to develop a spacecraft capable of safely ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, a controversial decision considering that NASA had never before outsourced the development of a human-rated spacecraft. The idea was that commercial companies could drive down costs and spur innovation and NASA would have more time and resources to focus on exploring deeper into the solar system. 
            </p>

            <p>With this mission becoming a success after NASA and SpaceX performs the liftoff at Florida's Kennedy Space Center in Brevard County from "Pad 39A," a historic site that has been the starting point of missions dating back to the Apollo era, including the first moon landing in 1969. SpaceX is currently leasing the launch pad from NASA for the launch on 30 May 2020 at 19:22:45 UTC.as bad weather or technical issues got in the way of its scheduled liftoff  on Wednesday at 4:33 pt ET and with Crew Dragon docking to the space station about 19 hours after launch having Behnken and Hurley,former military test pilots onboard, NASA won't have to ask Russia for rides anymore! *wink**wink*
